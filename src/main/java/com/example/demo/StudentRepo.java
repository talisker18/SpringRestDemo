	 * 
	 * UserEntity, in this case Student â€“ is the name of the Entity class which you can find below in this tutorial. 
	 * When we create SQL queries with JPQL, we query not the database table by its name but by an Entity class name. 
	 * This is a very important difference between JPQL SQL Queries and the Native SQL queries. When creating a Native SQL 
	 * query we would use a database name in the query but in the JPQL, we need to use an Entity class name and not the database table name.
